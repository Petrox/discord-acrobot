# discord-acrobot

Updated to work with Oct 2022 version of async, discord.py and discordy API.

Code is still a mess though can't handle games in parallel, has no logging, error handling, configuration, slash commands or any stored state.

Don't use it without adapting.

Add your discord app token in the config.py, but never commit that file.
